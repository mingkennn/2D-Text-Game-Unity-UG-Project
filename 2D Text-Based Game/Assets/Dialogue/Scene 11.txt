You: Criminal! Stop and put your hands up!
Criminal: How! I thought I would have had more time!
You: I guess you thought wrong!
Officer Jones: Sorry! I was late, you ran quite quick Detective!
You: All in a days work Officer.
Officer: Say, would you want a drink? It’ll be on me. Of course after we handle the criminal properly.
Player: This does look like a nice place to get one!
Officer Jones : yeah this is where the University hold some of their clubbing events but also where they sell their drinks sort of like a local pub in a sense?
You: Yeah, ill take the offer. It’ll be nice to chill for a bit since we solved the crime quite quickly
