Officer Jones: You know on our left here is the Graduate Centre, a place where a lot of economics and finance degrees takes place at. On our front is the place where a lot of the architectural degree takes place.
You: You sure are taking the time to sight see the place huh.
Officer Jones: I’m simply just happy we’re here again as I graduated here a long time ago.
You: Well anyways...
You: There was only one clue there and it’s again very similar to what was left in the canteen earlier…
You: Are you sure there isn’t any other locations within this campus that handles cash like this?
Officer Jones: Hmmmm…..
Officer Jones: Actually… There is a place that sells drinks within the campus.
You: Jones! Quickly! We have to get there quickly as the criminal might genuinely be there!
Officer: Okay Detective!
