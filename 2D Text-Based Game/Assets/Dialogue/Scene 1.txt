Officer Jones:  Welcome Detective! We are in a bit of a chaotic situation here, so I will be in charge of briefing you what has happened before you arrived.
Officer Jones: The criminal is currently on the loose in the campus and we’re trying to catch up to him but we’re currently figuring out as to where he has gone to now.
Officer Jones: Right now, we need to examine the place where his first crime was committed which is the cafeteria.
Officer Jones: Fortunately there was only one student that was only injured with bruises but the criminal was bleeding as far as we are aware as there are blood stains
