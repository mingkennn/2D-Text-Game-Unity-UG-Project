Officer Jones: Just so you know, Yes.. Queen Mary does have a cafeteria.
Officer Jones: The cafeteria is a place where Queen Mary Students frequently visit for healthy food that changes every day within the campus and are usually very delightful to eat.
Officer Jones: There is a Starbucks within there
Officer Jones: This leads me to come up with the conclusion that the criminal realises that there is a lot of cash being handled there due to students frequenting the area.
You : That makes a logical sense officer.
