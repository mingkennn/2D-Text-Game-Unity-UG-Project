Player: Ground Café?
Officer Jones: Yes, that is a Café within the campus that students usually frequent for their food as well as fresh coffee that is usually cheaper and taste quite well for their prices.
Officer Jones: The people who work at the Ground Café are usually students as well so it’s a place where Students are served by Students.
Player: Is the food there better than here?
Officer Jones: Debatable if you prefer cold prepacked food like sushi or sandwiches or fresh hot food here.
Officer Jones: I thought you weren't the talking type
Player: Well, It was hectic just now but since we're on the chase now, might as well have some small talk.
