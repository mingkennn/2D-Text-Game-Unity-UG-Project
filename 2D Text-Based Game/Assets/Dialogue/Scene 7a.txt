Café Worker:  Officer! Officer!
Officer Jones: Yes mam? Please calm down and explain to us what the situation is here.
Café Worker: Yes… *Takes Deep Breath*
Café Worker: The Criminal was here just but ran out some time ago and is probably still on the loose.
Café Worker: He then stormed off out the front door and ran away in the direction of the library.
You: Officer Jones! There could be a clue left in the library to tell us where he could be. Lets check there after we gather what we found here
Officer Jones: Detective, you know this place is quite cozy and nice for a student established café ya know?
Officer Jones: Sorry Detective got side-tracked for a bit but yes you’re most likely right. But lets focus on finding the clues here first.
